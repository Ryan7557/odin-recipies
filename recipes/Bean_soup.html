    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Bean Soup comes to you from El Bulli restaurant, famed in its time for topping the World's 50 Best Restaurant list, year after year.
        But fear not! This is not a complex Michelin star dish.
        It's a simple bean soup from the El Bulli staff cookbook.</p>
    
    <p>Our vegetarian bean soup is made with ingredients you probably already have in your kitchen, including carrots, onions, celery, and garlic, canned beans, and canned tomatoes.
        The hearty dish makes a great dinner and requires just 25 minutes of prep; then, the soup simmers on the stovetop until the vegetables are tender. 
        If you omit the parmesan for serving, this soup is also vegan</p>
